# Team 5

Team members: Alan C, Ashlynn H, Hunter T, Kevin N This project is for TCMG 412.

The purpose is to build a simple REST API in Python, containerize it using Docker, and then upload it into the Docker public respository.

The URI endpoints should return a JSON payload that consists of an input and output value.

(Could not get key val to work properly)
